Overview
========

IMPORTANT: The UserVoice iPhone SDK is currently in beta, if you wish to try it out please visit this url to request access:

http://www.uservoice.com/iphone

The UserVoice iPhone SDK is distributed as a XCode Project which you can use to build static libraries to compile against. 

This distribution concept is well described in this post:

http://www.clintharris.net/2009/iphone-app-shared-libraries/

In order to embed the UserVoice functionality into your own iPhone app, you need to perform the following steps:

1. Have a UserVoice account!
2. Clone the SDK from GitHub (or download the zip)
3. Add the SDK to your project (a simple drag'n'drop followed by updating a few settings)
4. Add the UserVoice resources
5. Register your iPhone app on the UserVoice website
6. Add an '#import' and a single line of code where you want to invoke the UserVoice functionality

The instructions below describe this process in more detail.


Instructions
============

Add the SDK to your project
------------------------------
* Go to the directory where you cloned the SDK (or where you unzipped it) and click on UserVoice.xcodeproj
* Drag the UserVoice group to the root of your app project


Update Build Settings
---------------------

* Double-click on the app target.

* Click on the General tab.
* In 'Direct Dependencies' click add and choose UserVoice.
* In 'Linked Libraries' add QuartzCore.framework, SystemConfiguration.framework.

* Click on the Build tab.
* Make sure that the Configuration drop-down shows "All Configurations".

* Look for Header Search Paths.
* Double-click, then add "PATH_TO_USERVOICE_SDK/**" (replace with the path to the downloaded UserVoice SDK, the ** is very important)

* Look for Other Linker Flags.
* Double-click, then add "-ObjC".


Update Binary Linked Libraries
------------------------------

* Drag libUserVoice.a from within the UserVoice group to 'Link Binary With Libraries' in your app's target.


Add Resources
-------------

* Create a group called UVResources
* Right-click on UVResources, then choose Add -> Existing Files.
* Select the "UserVoice/Resources" folder. In the dialog, leave "Copy items..." unchecked and then click Add.
* Right-click on your project and choose Add -> Existing Files.
* Select the Categories folder from the UserVoiceSDK directory. In the dialog, leave "Copy items..." unchecked and then click Add.


Obtain Key And Secret
-----------------------

* Go to the admin section of your UserVoice account and click 'Apps & Plugins'.
* Click on the iPhone tab and click create.
* Make a note of your key and secret and of your forum URL.


Import UserVoiceSDK
-------------------

* Add the following import statement to the class that is responsible for launching the UserVoice view (probably a view controller):

    #import "UserVoice.h"
	

Invoke UserVoice View - Standard Login
--------------------------------------

* In your view controller, where you want to invoke the UserVoice view (probably from a button action), use the following code:

	[UserVoice presentUserVoiceModalViewControllerForParent:self
													andSite:@"YOUR_USERVOICE_URL"
													 andKey:@"YOUR_KEY"
												  andSecret:@"YOUR_SECRET"];
												  
Invoke UserVoice View - SSO With Existing Users
-----------------------------------------------

* In your view controller, where you want to invoke the UserVoice view (probably from a button action), use the following code:

	[UserVoice presentUserVoiceModalViewControllerForParent:self
													andSite:@"YOUR_USERVOICE_URL"
													 andKey:@"YOUR_KEY"
												  andSecret:@"YOUR_SECRET",
												andSSOToken:@"SOME_BIG_LONG_SSO_TOKEN"];


Invoke UserVoice View - SSO With New Users Only
-----------------------------------------------
												  
* In your view controller, where you want to invoke the UserVoice view (probably from a button action), use the following code:

	[UserVoice presentUserVoiceModalViewControllerForParent:self
													andSite:@"YOUR_USERVOICE_URL"
													 andKey:@"YOUR_KEY"
												  andSecret:@"YOUR_SECRET"
												   andEmail:@"USER_EMAIL"
											 andDisplayName:@"USER_DISPLAY_NAME"
													andGUID:@"GUID"];

TODO
----

## performance

* Cache more info (client config?) to improve initial load time

## functionality

* Facebook and Google auth support
* Add resend email confirmation functionality

## appearance

* Info button image is being cropped
* Still some text cropping on descenders

## architecture

* Always store the token and just use type to figure out if its request or access
